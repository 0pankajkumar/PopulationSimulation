# PopulationSimulation
A simulation of Human population starting at 2000 B.C.
Starting with very few ancestors the program bulids up the ppopulation i runtime.
Humans are created using objects concept which is nuts & bolts for java.

## Moto
The sole purpose of churning the cpu with this code is to see how human population grows based on certain factors.
Criterias & phenomenas deciding the death & growth will be subjected to lot of edits & updates since the world was hard to predict from its genesis & we are just playing around it.

## Selection of langauage : Java
Since, a lot of human objects will be created which will become a mess when we reach population explosions. So, to avoid garbage collection problem **Java** has been chosen which provides the juice for free. Ofcourse, Python and other friends can do the same job. But today it is a Java day.

## Rules of the Game
